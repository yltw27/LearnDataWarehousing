# LearnDataWarehousing

### General Data Engineer Job Requirements
We can assume the data engineers are specialists from the field of software engineering and backend development.
- Knowledge of Python, Java or Scala
- Knowledge of algorithms and data structures
- Good understanding of SQL and NoSQL databases (data modeling, data warehousing)
- Understanding the basics of distributed systems
- Experience with big data: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka
- Experience with cloud platforms, in particular, Amazon Web Services
- Experience with data visualization tools like Tableau or ElasticSearch will be a big plus
